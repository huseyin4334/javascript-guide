      defer attribute is important. Because we want to execute our scripts after the DOM is loaded.
      If we don't use defer attribute, our scripts will be executed before the DOM is loaded.
      So we can't access the DOM elements.

      We are saying with defer attribute, download scripts but not execute scripts before html parsed and dom loaded.
      Execute scripts after html parsed and dom loaded.

      async attribute is important. Because we want to execute our scripts as soon as possible.
      We are using this attribute for scripts that we don't need to wait for DOM to be loaded.
      If we don't use async attribute, our scripts will download and execute before the DOM is loaded. So DOM have to wait for scripts.

      We are saying with async attribute, download scripts and execute scripts parallel with html parsing and dom loading.

      If you use async attribute, We can't garantee the order of execution of scripts.

<!--
  if I create script tag in the head tag, it will be executed before the body tag is loaded
  so if I try to access the DOM elements, it will not work.
  But We have other ways to do that. We will see later.

  If you will use other scripts in your app.js script, you should put them firstly. (except functions, because they are not executed immediately)
  Because arrangement is important.

  Html is parsed from top to bottom. So if you put your script tag in the head tag, it will be executed before the body tag is loaded.

<!--
<script>
  alert('Hello from the head tag!');

  Developer tools -> Performance
  You can see the performance of your app.
  You can see the loading time of your app.
  You can see details while browser is loading page. How is render page, how is parse html, how is execute scripts etc.
  We can understand what is the bottleneck of our app.
